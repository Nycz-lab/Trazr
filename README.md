### Description ℹ
    This small javascript application monitors omegle connections and
    returns their information in the console. This showcases how
    insecure and bad the webrtc protocol is implemented into their
    service. Since the website doesnt allow most VPNs and proxies
    this is particularly bad. PLEASE FIX THIS OMEGLE

    This tool is for educational purposes only!

### Installation 💻
    There is no real installation in fact you just paste the Trazr.js
    code into your browsers javascript console while being on the omegle
    page. Also dont paste code you dont understand into your console

    

    Step 0:
        Navigate to Omegle lol

    Step 1:
        Press CTRL + SHIFT + I

        Now a window should pick up. These are the browsers dev tools
    
    Step 2:
        Navigate to the Console Tab inside the Dev Tools

    Step 3:
        Copy Paste the file content of Trazr.js into the console

    Congratulations that's all however you will need to do that every
    time you want to use this app since the changes are not persistent
    (Every time you close dev tools)
    Keep dev tools open -> use omegle video chat -> see magic happen 🧙‍♂️

    You can also close the console after inserting the code Trazr will 
    log the information to the omegle chat as well however keep in mind
    that this will not show the history

    cheers
